# Weather app - React

![App Screenshot](/src/assets/img-readme.png)

# Overview

The Weather App is a web application built with React that allows users to retrieve weather information for different cities around the world. The app fetches data from the [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org) API, providing real-time weather updates including temperature, humidity, wind speed, and feels like.

The project incorporates a responsive design, ensuring a seamless user experience across various devices. The initial design was created using Figma, a popular design tool, to ensure an aesthetically pleasing and intuitive user interface.

# Technologies Used

- React: JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- [OpenWeatherMap API](https://openweathermap.org/api/one-call-3): Data source for weather forecast information.
